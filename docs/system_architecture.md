# TechSolutions Dublin - Task Management System: System Architecture

## Overview

The TechSolutions Dublin Task Management System uses a client-server architecture with a RESTful API approach, focused on simplicity and maintainability. This document outlines the system architecture, components, and data flow.

## Components

### 1. Frontend (Client-Side)

- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User interface rendering
  - Form input and validation
  - API request handling
  - Dynamic content updates
  - Responsive design for various devices

### 2. Backend (Server-Side)

- **Technologies**: Python, Flask
- **Responsibilities**:
  - API endpoint handling
  - Request validation
  - Business logic processing
  - Data manipulation
  - Response formatting
  - Error handling

### 3. Data Storage

- **Technology**: JSON file-based storage
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Task data persistence
  - Data retrieval
  - Data modification

## Data Flow

1. **Create Task**:
   - User inputs task data through frontend form
   - Frontend validates input and sends POST request to API
   - Backend validates request, generates ID, adds timestamps
   - Task saved to JSON storage
   - Response returned to frontend
   - UI updated to show new task

2. **Read Tasks**:
   - Frontend sends GET request to API
   - Backend retrieves tasks from JSON storage
   - Tasks filtered based on query parameters (if any)
   - Response returned to frontend
   - UI displays task list

3. **Update Task**:
   - User edits task through frontend form
   - Frontend validates input and sends PUT request to API
   - Backend validates request, updates task in JSON storage
   - Response returned to frontend
   - UI updated to show changes

4. **Delete Task**:
   - User selects delete action
   - Frontend sends DELETE request to API
   - Backend removes task from JSON storage
   - Response returned to frontend
   - UI removes task from display

## API Communication

All communication between frontend and backend uses RESTful HTTP requests:

- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Method-based semantics**: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)
- **Status codes**: Standard HTTP status codes for success/failure

## Security Considerations

While this is a proof-of-concept application, in a production environment, the following security measures would be implemented:

- Authentication and authorization
- HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection
- Content Security Policy

## Scalability Potential

The current architecture can be extended by:

1. Replacing JSON storage with a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
2. Adding authentication and user management
3. Implementing caching for improved performance
4. Adding additional microservices for specific functionality
5. Containerizing components for easier deployment and scaling
