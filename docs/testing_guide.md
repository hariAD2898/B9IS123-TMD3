# TechSolutions Dublin - Task Management System: Testing Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the testing procedures for the TechSolutions Dublin Task Management System. The system includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure its functionality is working as expected.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized in the `tests/` directory:

```
tests/
├── test_api.py         # Unit tests for the API endpoints
└── test_integration.py # Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
```

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have:

1. Installed all dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up your environment (development or testing)

### Running All Tests

To run the complete test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Running Specific Test Files

To run a specific test file:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_api.py
```

Or:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_integration.py
```

### Running Specific Test Methods

To run a specific test method:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_api.TaskAPITestCase.test_get_all_tasks
```

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

### API Tests (`test_api.py`)

These tests verify the functionality of the API endpoints:

- `test_get_all_tasks`: Tests retrieving all tasks
- `test_get_task_by_id`: Tests retrieving a specific task by ID
- `test_get_nonexistent_task`: Tests error handling for non-existent tasks
- `test_create_task`: Tests creating a new task
- `test_create_task_missing_fields`: Tests validation when required fields are missing
- `test_update_task`: Tests updating an existing task
- `test_update_nonexistent_task`: Tests error handling when updating a non-existent task
- `test_delete_task`: Tests deleting a task
- `test_delete_nonexistent_task`: Tests error handling when deleting a non-existent task
- `test_filter_tasks`: Tests the task filtering functionality

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.

### End-to-End Tests (`test_integration.py`)

These tests simulate user interactions with the system:

- `test_full_task_lifecycle`: Tests the complete lifecycle of a task (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Test Data

The tests create and use temporary test data, which is cleaned up after each test run. This ensures that tests do not interfere with each other and can be run repeatedly.

## Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality to the system, corresponding tests should be added:

1. For new API endpoints or modifications, add tests to `test_api.py`
2. For significant feature additions, add integration tests to `test_integration.py`

### Test Template

```python
def test_new_feature(self):
    """Test description."""
    # Setup
    # ...
    
    # Action
    # ...
    
    # Assert
    # ...
```

## Continuous Integration

In a production environment, these tests would be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

## Test Coverage

To measure test coverage, you can use the `coverage` tool:

```bash
pip install coverage
coverage run -m unittest discover tests
coverage report
coverage html  # Generates a detailed HTML report
```

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Tests Failing

- Ensure data file paths are correct
- Check for changes in API responses
- Verify that the test environment is properly set up

### Test Hangs

- Check for infinite loops
- Ensure that all network requests have proper timeouts
- Verify that file operations close files properly

## Best Practices

1. Keep tests independent and isolated
2. Clean up test data after each test
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Test both success and failure cases
5. Keep tests fast and efficient
