# TechSolutions Dublin - Task Management System: Project Specifications

## Project Overview

This document outlines the specifications for the TechSolutions Dublin Task Management System, developed as a continuous assessment for course B9IS123-TMD3. The system is designed to fulfill the requirements of creating a basic information system for a specific organization with CRUD functionality using a JSON API.

## Assignment Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Organization-Specific System**: The system is designed for TechSolutions Dublin, a technology consulting company based in Dublin.

2. **CRUD Functionality**: The system implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for task management.

3. **API Architecture**: The system uses a RESTful API with the web frontend making API calls rather than post-and-refresh interaction.

4. **Technology Stack**:
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
   - Backend: Python, Flask
   - Data Storage: JSON file-based storage

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and uncomplicated, with appropriate input elements and clear results display.

6. **Testing**: The system includes unit tests for CRUD functions and integration tests for frontend-backend interaction.

### System Features

1. **Task Management**:
   - Create new tasks with title, description, department, assigned staff, priority
   - View existing tasks with filtering capabilities
   - Update task details including status changes
   - Delete tasks when completed or no longer needed

2. **Data Organization**:
   - Tasks organized by department
   - Staff assignment tracking
   - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
   - Status tracking (Pending, In Progress, Review, Completed)

3. **User Interface**:
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Intuitive form for task creation and editing
   - Clear visual indicators for task priority and status
   - Filtering system for finding specific tasks

## Documentation

The project documentation includes:

1. **README**: General overview and instructions
2. **System Architecture**: Technical design and components
3. **API Documentation**: Endpoint descriptions and usage
4. **User Guide**: Instructions for using the system
5. **Data Schema**: Data structure and relationships
6. **Installation Guide**: Setup and configuration instructions
7. **Testing Guide**: Test procedures and coverage

## Assessment Criteria

This project addresses the assessment criteria as follows:

1. **Design and Requirements**: Clearly defined requirements for a task management system for a specific company.

2. **System Architecture**: Implemented a client-server architecture with RESTful API communication.

3. **CRUD Implementation**: Complete implementation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for tasks.

4. **User Interface**: Developed a user-friendly interface with appropriate HTML elements for input and display.

5. **Testing**: Included unit tests for API endpoints and integration tests for full task lifecycle.

6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of system design, implementation, and usage.

## Assignment Constraints

The project adheres to the constraints specified in the assignment:

1. **Individual Project**: Developed entirely by a single student.

2. **Technology Requirements**: Uses JavaScript for frontend and Python for backend with JSON-based data storage.

3. **API Focus**: Implements an API-based architecture rather than traditional post-and-refresh interactions.

4. **Proof-of-Concept Scope**: Demonstrates core functionality while acknowledging potential future enhancements.

5. **Code Attribution**: All external libraries and resources properly attributed and used in accordance with their licenses.

## Conclusion

The TechSolutions Dublin Task Management System fulfills the requirements of the continuous assessment by implementing a basic information system with CRUD functionality for a specific organization using an API-based architecture. The system demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript and Python programming, as well as understanding of web application architecture and development principles.
